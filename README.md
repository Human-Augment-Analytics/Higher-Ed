# Higher Education Project

The goal of this project is to create and maintain a structure for large research groups in higher education. Code base solutions, contribution tracking, resource management, researcher support, and program development are included in this project. Additionally, members of this team often participate in additional projects individually, as directed. The goals of the higher education project are the following:

1) Code Management
2) Resource Management
3) Program Development

# Code Management

There were four code base goals for the higher education project. They were the following:

1) Code needs to be open source and easily accessible. (No “lost” code.)
2) Code contributions need to be tracked for publication attributions. 
3) Code needs to be marked as either: in-progress, tested and documented, or abandoned.
4) The instructor has to clearly be able to see the code you wrote each week. 

The following are the proposed solutions: 

1) Code needs to be open source and easily accessible. (No “lost” code.)

    Solution: Public repository in Human-Augmented-Analytics for each project.

    It was determined that a public repository should exist inside of Human-Augmented-Analytics for each project. This was discussed with the student researchers and talked through here, but merge conflicts, repository size limits, and usability concerns for researchers were the primary reasons that this was decided. For each project repository, topics can be added, and then those topics can be searched for on the organization home page.

2) Code contributions need to be tracked for publication attributions. 

    Solution: Use GitHub insights.

    Initially, code was written to read git logs and calculate the percentage contribution of each contributor. However, it seems much more logical to just use GitHub’s insights tab, which is attached to each repository. One can very quickly see which contributors should be cited and you can filter by commits, additions, or deletions. See the screenshot below:

3) Code needs to be marked as either: in-progress, tested and documented, or abandoned.

    Solution: Use GitHub projects to track sections of project code.

    At first, workflow code for tagging individual files was proposed, but, when talking to student researchers, it was determined that tagging each file would probably be too tedious, especially for certain projects. Instead, each project can be broken down into sections, and we can track the progress of the code through GitHub projects. See the screenshot of the template below:

4) The instructor has to clearly be able to see the code you wrote each week. 

    Solution: In their report, students can give both links to the files that they worked on and screenshots of the code blocks from that week.
