# Read Me (How to use the Repository)

Please read all of the information below on the proper procedures for utilizing this repository. The intended flow of scripts is:

**Junkyard -> Thrift Shop -> Tested and Documented**

# Important Tips and Reminders

Most of the workflow can be done from the GitHub web page. When editing a file, you can edit the file path. A couple important notes:

**You can add/create a folder within the path by adding a '/'** (e. g) "HAAG-Scripts-Repo/"

# Junkyard

Scripts here are untested/undocumented and someone needs to pick them for testing/documentation. 

## Adding Files to Junkyard
First make sure that all relevant files (code, docs, resources, plugins, etc.) are located within one parent folder to represent the whole project/program. Then click 'Add file' next to 'About' then click 'Upload files' then upload the entire parent folder.

***All scripts and projects should be uploaded with a parent folder***

## Picking Up Files
First, navigate to the parent folder of the project you wish to pick up and copy the URL at the top of your browser. Then go to Open [https://download-directory.github.io/](https://download-directory.github.io/) and paste the link to download a Zip of that directory.

**Ensure that the project was properly downloaded**

Navigate back to the parent folder within the repository, click '. . .' and click 'Delete directory'
Within the commit message write your name and what project/program you are picking up.
For the description write where in the Thrift Shop (or Graveyard) you will move it. Please refer to [Adding Files to Thrift Shop](#adding-files-to-thrift-shop) or [Moving from Junkyard/Thrift Shop to Graveyard](#moving-from-junkyard/thrift-shop-to-graveyard) to properly add the project to Thrift Shop/Graveyard.
